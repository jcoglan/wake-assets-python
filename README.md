# wake_assets

This package helps you render links to assets managed using
[wake](http://github.com/jcoglan/wake). It's easy to set up and works with any
Python web framework.


## Usage

These examples are based on the [wake example build
config](https://github.com/jcoglan/wake#usage).

#### At boot time

When your app boots, create an instance of `Assets` and keep this object around
through the lifetime of the app process. For example, in Django:

```python
# In your site's settings.py

import os.path
from wake_assets import Assets

WAKE_ASSETS = Assets(
    wake  = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'node_modules', '.bin', 'wake'),
    root  = os.getcwd(),
    mode  = 'targets',
    cache = True,
)
```

The options are:

* `wake` - the path to your `wake` executable
* `root` - the document root of your application
* `mode` - `sources` if you want to render links to source files, `targets`
  if you want optimised files
* `cache` - whether to cache `wake` metadata that's read from disk

#### At request time

On each request, create a renderer from your `Assets` instance. This renderer
takes per-request tag creation settings and provides methods for generating
HTML. In Django, you might do this using a middleware, and a context processor
to add the renderer to the template context. Start by creating an app skeleton:

```
$ mkdir -p assets/templatetags
$ touch assets/models.py assets/templatetags/__init__.py
```

Then add this to the app you just created:

```python
# assets/__init__.py

import json
import os
from django.conf import settings

CONFIG_PATH = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'package.json')
ASSET_HOSTS = json.loads(open(CONFIG_PATH).read())['wake']['css']['hosts']

class AssetsMiddleware:
    def process_request(self, request):
        request.assets = settings.WAKE_ASSETS.renderer(
            builds = {
                'css':        'ssl' if request.is_secure else 'min',
                'javascript': 'min',
                'binary':     'min',
            },
            hosts  = ASSET_HOSTS['production']['https' if request.is_secure else 'http'],
            inline = False,
        )

def assets_context(request):
    return {'assets': request.assets}
```

Adding `assets.AssetsMiddleware` to `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` and
`assets.assets_context` to `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS` will wire these into
your stack.

The options are:

* `builds` - which build to use for each asset type, the default for each is
  `min`
* `hosts` - the set of asset hosts to use for rendering links, the default is
  an empty list
* `inline` - whether to render assets inline so the browser does not make
  additional requests for them, default is `False`

#### In your templates

With this helper in place, you can render links to JavaScript, CSS and images:

```python
assets.include_js('scripts.js')
# => '<script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/scripts-bb210c6.js"></script>'

assets.include_css('style.css')
# => '<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/styles-5a2ceb1.css">'

assets.include_image('logo.png', html={'alt': 'Logo'})
# => '<img src="/assets/logo-2fa8d38.png" alt="Logo">'
```

You can pass the `inline` option to any of these to override the per-request
`inline` setting:

```python
assets.include_js('scripts.js', inline=True)
# => '<script type="text/javascript">alert("Hello, world!")</script>'
```

For Django, you should bind these to custom template tags. Add the following to
`assets/templatetags/asset_tags.py`:

```python
# assets/templatetags/asset_tags.py

from django import template
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe

register = template.Library()

@register.simple_tag(takes_context=True)
def include_css(context, *names, **options):
    assets = context['assets']
    return mark_safe(assets.include_css(*names, **options))

@register.simple_tag(takes_context=True)
def include_image(context, *names, **options):
    assets = context['assets']
    return mark_safe(assets.include_image(*names, **options))

@register.simple_tag(takes_context=True)
def include_js(context, *names, **options):
    assets = context['assets']
    return mark_safe(assets.include_js(*names, **options))
```

Adding `assets` to `INSTALLED_APPS` will make these tags available in templates.
Use them like this:

```
{% load asset_tags %}

{% include_js 'scripts.js' %}

{% include_image 'logo.png' inline=True %}
```
